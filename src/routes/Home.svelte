            The Akkadian Revival Project was created in 2019 to work on the
            Akkadian language (the Old Babylonian dialect more precisely) and
            make it a usable language for the modern life.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">
            The project consists of various sub-projects focused on different
            domains: the creation of new words, the cuneiforms, a dictionary,
            the creation of content, etc.
          </p>
